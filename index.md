# 3 Joint Robotic Arm With Claw
The 3 Joint Robotic Arm is a fun device that is controlled using a controller and can move 360 degrees! The claw on the robot is even capable of carrying small objects.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was the assembly of my intensive project, the 3 Joint Robot Arm. I completed the assembly of the arm and for the arm I first started by building the base which holds down the battery, the arduino with its nano shield, and the motor which moves the base of the arm. There are 4 motors in total controlling the movement of the arm. The base motor controls the direction that the arm is in. 2 motors control 2 different hinges while there is another motor that controls the claw. The claw is only attached to one finger of the claw but the other is also in motion as a result of the gear that connects the two fingers. I also took time to cable manage the motor wires so that it would not hinder the movement of the robot. Finally I wrote some code to reset the robot to its original position whenever the arduino is on so when i change the direction of the motors and turn on the arduino, the arm will return to 90 degrees. I had trouble screwing down the base of the arm to the motor which hindered the motors ability to move the robot. The screw was too short, and I then found a longer screw to screw down the base to the motor. Next I plan to assemble, connect, and test the controller. I plan to write code to recieve and print the output of the joystick module.

# Starter Project
My starter project is the Useless box, a prank box that provides hours of entertainment! The box itself is activated when the switch at the top is flipped, and then the acrylic arm attached the a motor is propelled up and the arm flips a hinge up and hits the switch again to turn it off. After the switch is hit by the arm, the arm retracts and hits a snap switch which stops the arm. The PCB has an LED, a snap switch, PCB terminal, and the switch at the top of the box soldered on. The build itself is powered by 3 triple-A batteries. While building the project i had an extremely hard time securing the case which I eventually solved by using a clamp to secure the corner posts so that i could put a screw through the post. This created an imprint of the screw which eventually made it easier to screw into the box. Next I plan to use my knowledge about motors to build the 3 Joint Robotic Arm.
